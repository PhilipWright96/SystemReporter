# Goal

To produce a simple program which will show helpful machine diagnostics to users.

Starting the App

1. Clone Repo.
2. Run the command 'npm start'. This will compile the typescript and run the program.

To run all tests, run the command 'npm test'. You will also automatically get coverage statistics from
this command on the terminal.

Debugging the App
To debug the app, simply start it normally. Then you can go on to the google inspector page with control + shift + i. From there, you can add breakpoints - and then refresh the app to hit those breakpoints.
